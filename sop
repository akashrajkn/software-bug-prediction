tyro in computer science



It was only during my freshman year I interacted with a computer at length. I was mesmerized by the sophistication it took to make it, let alone imagine the intricate electronics that went in making it. The course on introductory computer programming was what (epoch-making) steered me towards the realm of computer science. My naive curiosity as to how computer games are made with such brilliance sparked my interest towards algorithm development. Wishing to explore more in this area, I started coding a lot and learnt a glut of algorithms. 

The interest in algorithm development made me work on a project where I learnt about the approximation algorithms and later went on to complete a detailed analyses of approximation algorithms for vertex cover problem on Eulerian graphs. The analyses clearly proved that something more was required when dealing with non-planar graphs. Under the guidance of Dr. Michael Alphonse, I explored the possibility of
